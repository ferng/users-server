# Environment

## Execution
* Compile codebase: `tsc`
* Start server: `npm start` 

## General notes
* Currently specific dependency versions are defined, this is purely for this exercise, alternative version control could be used in a production system (or not).

## Data
* For this excercise any existing data is wiped and a set of test data is created everytime the app is started, if you don't wish to happen simply comment out the line `Generator.users()` in index.ts
